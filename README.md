# Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

## Milestone 1 – Legacy System Analysis and Requirements Gathering

---

## Project Title
AI Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

---

## Internship Program
Infosys Springboard Internship 2026

---

## Project Overview

The Conversational IVR Modernization Framework aims to transform legacy VoiceXML (VXML)-based Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems into AI-enabled conversational systems.

Traditional IVR systems rely on static menu-driven navigation and DTMF input, which limits flexibility and user experience. This project introduces Conversational AI capabilities while preserving existing legacy infrastructure to minimize redevelopment effort.

## Use Case

Pre-Consultant Trivage IVR (Legacy VXML-Based System)

The existing system is built on VXML architecture and supports structured call flows such as:

- Appointment booking  
- Consultant routing  
- Service inquiries  
- General customer support  

However, it lacks natural language understanding, contextual awareness, and intelligent routing.

---

## Problem Statement

The legacy IVR system presents several limitations:

- Rigid menu-based navigation  
- No intent recognition  
- No conversational capability  
- Limited scalability  
- High modification effort  

The objective is to modernize the system by integrating it with Conversational AI platforms such as ACS and BAP while reusing legacy components.

---

## Milestone 1 Scope

This milestone focuses on system analysis and requirement gathering.

### Key Activities

- Review of existing VXML architecture  
- Identification of integration requirements  
- Gap analysis between legacy IVR and conversational AI  
- Risk assessment  
- Feasibility evaluation  
- Definition of modernization strategy
